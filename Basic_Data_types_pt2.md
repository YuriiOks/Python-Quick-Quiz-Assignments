### Question 1: 

Consider two integers, `a` and `b`:

```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 10

output = num1 * (num1 == num2) + num1 * (num1 > num2) + num2 * (num1 < num2)
print(output)

```

What will this code print?

- **A)** 10
- **B)** 20
- **C)** 30
- **D)** 40
- **E)** 50

### Question 3:


Consider the following Python code:

```python
# Enter a 4 digit number
number = int(input("Enter a 4 digit number: "))

# Extracting the digits
digit_1 = number // 1000
digit_2 = number % 1000 // 100
digit_3 = number % 100 // 10
digit_4 = number % 10

print(digit_1 + digit_2 + digit_3 + digit_4)
```

Given this code, which pair of three-digit numbers would produce the highest and lowest possible sums of their digits?

- **A)** Highest: 9999, Lowest: 1000
- **B)** Highest: 36, Lowest: 1
- **C)** Highest: 900, Lowest: 1000
- **D)** Highest: 9999, Lowest: 1
- **E)** Highest: 27, Lowest: 1
